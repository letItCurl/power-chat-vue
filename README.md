Tired of action cable ? Redis ? and server configs to build instant chat app ?
Let's try realtime feature on firebase !
Basicly it's a feature that is given in the library of firebase, it allow to listen only when there is a change in the document.

# <a class='text-center' href="https://power-chat-vue.firebaseapp.com">Or click here to try it in your browser!</a>

> Db and hosting in firebase.

# How to test ?

Just open two regular browser, enter two names and you are good to know !

# Is this real-world ready ?

Noooooooooo! there is no data validation and no uniquess of users...

# Though

I'm a rails developer, i see the world in a MVC perspective.
This way of developing app can be beacome a huge mess very quickly if we don't organise the routes properly.
I feel like my two year of experience in rails will be a huge asset for ressource managment. 
It's very fun to see how the way of querying data in firebase is quite the same even if this is not an sql server...

# What's next ?

Let's build somthing with real user auth and data validation.
